    <p>The first "bigger" project I made. It probably has my most time spent in a project.
    I had originally made this in Java, but I ported it to C#/Windows Forms because of the speed of development.
    I also just wanted to try WinForms. It will create files, save files, and open files. You can also change the font,
    font size, and font decoration. It starts by creating a default directory for itself,
    then you can also input a new directory that it will save to a json file for future reference.</p>

    <p>This project is a bit like a text editor, but in a console. With it, you can create, save and delete files.
    Similar functionality to "Text Editor".</p>

    <span class="projectTitles" id="RedditDownloader">RedditDownloader</span>
    <p>This is an app I made with the purpose of downloading images and videos from Reddit, from the commandline. I remember when I was making it,
    I was having a really hard time getting the OAuth request to go through. Turns out I was missing a "?" in my request.</p>

    <span class="projectTitles" id="MyFirstPong">MyFirstPong</span>
    <p class="MyFirstPongP">My most recent project, it is also my most ambitious and the one I am most proud of. It's a clone of Pong.
    There's probably better clones out there, but I'd like to think of it as "Pong, but more modernized".
    Inside the settings, you can change the variables most impactful on gameplay, including ball speed, ball angle,
    as well as the speed of each individual paddle. There are color options for changing the color of the font,
    along with the ball and paddles. You can also change the volume of the "pong" sound, as well as mute it. Hardware-accelerated.</p>

    <p class="MyFirstPongP">I was very, very frustrated at certain points in making this. It took me a while to get the math for the collision detection working,
    and then another while for the deflection of the ball. Probably around a week or so for each.
    Those things took the longest as far as I remember. I had to make several more custom classes that inherited from
    various classes within the game/OpenGL library I was using (libGDX). Most of them being shape and UI classes.
    This project helped me learn a lot.</p>
